A **system** in a space $\mathbb{X}$ is a collection of points in $\mathbb{X}$ that may move over time.

A system in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is said to be a **rigid body** if two things are true:

 - the distance between any two points in the body never changes over time
 - the "orientation" of the body is preserved over time.

A **mechanism** is a finite collection of rigid bodies $(b_1, \ldots, b_k)$ such that between $b_i$ and $b_{i+1}$ (for $1 \leq i < k$) there is a joint of some kind connecting the two bodies.

The collection of {affine isometries} is exactly the set of all compositions $t \circ k$ where $t$ is a {translation} and $k$ is a {central isometry}. {affine isometries proof}[(Proof)]
