{affine isometry}

Recall that an affine transformation can be characterized as a linear map followed by a translation.

An **affine isometry** is an affine transformation $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ which is also an isometry.

{translation}

A **translation** is any function $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ defined by $x \mapsto x + v$ for some $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$.

{central isometry}

A **central isometry** is an isometry of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that fixes the origin.

{affine isometries proof}

The collection of affine isometries on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is exactly the collection of compositions $t \circ k$ where $t$ is a translation of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $k$ is a central isometry.

*Proof:* blah blah blah math goes here. $\Box$
